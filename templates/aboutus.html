                Roming Routes was founded by travel enthusiast Alex Johnson, who, from a young age, was fascinated by the beauty and diversity of the world. At 19, Alex decided to dedicate his life to exploring new destinations and sharing these experiences with others. Traveling the globe, he gathered extensive knowledge about different cultures, cuisines, and landscapes.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a background in tourism management and a passion for adventure, Alex felt compelled to answer the call of wanderlust that many feel but few follow. With a modest sum of $32,000 saved from various travel gigs and personal savings, Alex opened Roming Routes, a travel agency dedicated to providing personalized and unforgettable travel experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
